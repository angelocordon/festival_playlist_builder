# Festival Playlist Builder

Small Ruby on Rails personal project to make building playlists for music festivals a more engaging and enjoyable experience.

## Development

TODO - add how to setup, install, and work on this project locally.

## Overview

### Problem Statement

Major music festivals regularly release a lineup, feature dozens of amazing and up-and-coming artists, but rarely do they release a comprehensive playlist for **all** of the artists at the festival.

### Current Solution

Currently, I manually build multiple playlists for each festival on Spotify:

- The initial release of artists (by day, without schedule) kicks off the process.
- I will typically build a "Top 5", "Top 10", and "Extensive" playlist.
  - **Top 5** - the five most popular songs by the artist OR the five featured songs (usually for new releases).
  - **Top 10** - the ten most popular songs by the artist.
  - **Extensive** - pretty much every song I can find for the artists.
  - *By Day* - a per-day playlist highlighting those artists listed to perform on a given day.
- From these playlists I'll start getting a sense of who I am interested in at each festival. I usually have a handful of artists I know, and heavily research/listen to the rest.
- Once the official schedule comes out, I'll build a final playlist based on the lineup I'm going to see.
- If I attend the festival, I'll usually create a final playlist featuring the artists I saw.
- If I don't attend but stream the festival instead, I'll create a new playlist featuring the artists which were focal in the stream.

This provides me with a good set of playlists both before and after the music fest.

### Project Milestones

- [ ] User accounts and Spotify OAuth to allow for the resulting playlist to be added to the user's account.
- [ ] Basic ability to utilize Ruby and the [RSpotify](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify) Gem to aid in the creation of festival playlists.
- [ ] More complex user experience and interface to allow for selection of artists and songs.
- [ ] Basic interface to allow "building" a playlist with user decision-making throughout the process.
- [ ] Advanced interface to allow for gradual listening to lead to new discoveries and suggestions.

### Project Goals

- Better, more stream-lined, and more engaging user-experience related to building music festival playlists.
- Utilize MaterialUI and React components in a personal project.
- Experiment with unique user experiences catered to discovery, learning, and listening to music.
- Allow exploration of new building experiences; ideally with a focus on listening and then adding based on experience.
